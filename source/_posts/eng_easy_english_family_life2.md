# 1. Sharing Chores

- Brian, your dad and I want you to start doing some chores（家务）.

- > But I already tidy up（/ˈtaɪdi ʌp/整理，收拾, tidy 表示 "使...整洁; 整理"） my room. Isn't that enough?

- You also need to do chores around the house.
The whole family must contribute（/kənˈtrɪbjuːt/为 ... 做出贡献） to how the household(n.家庭 adj. 家用的, 一家人的) runs(运行）,
When children help out(帮忙：在某人需要时提供援助或支持), chores get done sooner. 
This frees up(释放; 使某人有空闲时间) time for the family to do fun things together.

- >Okay, so what exactly do I have to do? 

- Let's start with putting dirty clothes in the hamper(带盖子的篮子, 美国特指"脏衣篓"), watering(water可以当动词, 意为"用水来做某事", 比如此处就是用水给植物浇水) the plants（植物） and taking out the trash（垃圾）.

- >okay, what else?

- how about setting and clearing the dining room table?

- >is that all? 

- And loading and unloading the dishwasher(洗碗机, dish: 碗; wash: 洗;). 

- >But I don't know how to do that. 

- I will teach you. It's really easy. 

- >Do I have to do all of these things every day? 

- No, I want you to share these chores with Leticia. 
you can both decide which ones you want to do. 

- >that's not fair（公平的）.

- why isn't this fair? 

- >She's going to pick the easiest（容易的，轻松的） ones for herself and give me the harder chores to do. 

- No, she won't. I'll take care of that. 

- >you don't know Leticia.
If I have to share chores with my sister, I am going to be doing most of the work.

- I'll keep an eye on her（盯着她） and make sure she won't cheat（欺骗; 逃避）, I promise. 


# 2.Giving Instructions

- Okay, so let me show（通过示范 教） you how to load（装载） the dishwasher.
 On the top rack（架子，支架） we must put the bowls（碗/boʊl/）, cups（cup的复数形式）, mugs（马克杯） and glasses（玻璃杯） facing down（面朝下） so the water will drain out. 
We need to leave space between the glasses and other items, because the water can cause the glasses to bang together and crack（破裂）.
- pretty easy so far（到目前为止） what do we put on the bottom rack? 
- The bottom rack should be used for plates, large bowls, pots and pants.
- what about the forks, spoons and knives? 
- We must put them in the cutlery basket.
- can I put this plate on the top rack? 
There's no room for it on the bottom rack. 
- no, we shouldn't overload the dishwasher.
- why not?
- a dishwasher is less effective if it's crammed full of stuff. 
The dishes will not come out clean.
we can watch the items that are left out by hand.
- The dishwasher is loaded now, what's next? 
- Next, we put the detergent（洗涤剂/dɪˈtɜːrdʒənt/） in the dishwasher. 
We open the detergent drawer（抽屉/drɔːr/）, add the tablet（片剂，丸/ˈtæblət/） with the red ball facing up and closed the drawer. 
Now let's choose the eco program（程序） and press start. 
Once（一旦） the cycle is finished, check that the detergent has done its job, it's fully（充分地，彻底地） rinsed（冲洗） away and that the dishes（餐具，dish的复数形式） are dry（干燥的，干的）.
If they're still don't let them drive for about 30 minutes before putting（put的现在分词形式） them away . 





# 3. Cooking Dinner

- Honey we're out of bread. Could you go to the store and buy two loaves?
- Yeah, sure no problem.
- And we also need some mangos, lemons and some avocados(/ ˌævəˈkɑːdəʊz /鳄梨) and two rolls of paper towels( towel巾, paper towel纸巾 ).
- Do you need any help with dinner mom?
- Yes, could you please make the mashed( 捣碎 ) potatoes?
- Ok, where are the potatoes?
- The patotoes are in the cellar(/ ˈselər /地窖,  cellular/ ˈseljələr /蜂窝式的). There are right in the middle under the cheese and between the pumpkin(南瓜) and the flour(/ ˈflaʊər /面粉) sacks(sack袋 ).
- And how many should I peel( 剥皮 )?
- About twenty will do.
- Where's the peeler?
- The peeler is in the second drawer to the right of the oven(/ ˈʌv(ə)n /烤箱 ).
- and really, you can use any of the pods.
- Is this one ok?
- It's perfect.
- Cover the potatoes with water and add a generous pinch(大捏：一种用于烹饪的量词，表示需要加入较多的调味料，但不是精确的量。pinch: 捏，掐，拧；一撮；偷窃；) of salt.
- Bring them to the boil and cook them for 30 minutes.
- What're you making there?
- Turkey meatballs.
- Wow, I love them! Please show me how to cook them!
- In a large bowl, combine ground(切碎的) turkey, bread crumbs(面包屑), 1 onion, parsley(芹菜), 2 eggs, garlic, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Then mix well.
- Add oil to the pan and wait a few seconds for it to heat up. Shape(使成型) the mixture in balls and carefully place them in the hot pan. Fry the meatballs until browned on all sides.
- That's it? It's not hard at all.
- That's right.
- The potatoes are really soft now.
- We must drain them and use the potatoes masher to mash the potatoes. Pour over some warm milk, then add a little butter and sour(/ ˈsaʊər /酸的) cream.


# 4. Setting The Table

- Dinner is almost ready.Let's set the table, Brian!
- Ok, dad.
- Let's put the plates and bowls on the table.
- Perfect. Now let's put a napkin(餐巾) on the table by each person's plate on the left side.
- Next, let's bring the spoons and forks.
- We're going to place the fork to the left of the plate.
- It's ok if I put it on top of the napkin?
- Better put it next to it. The knife will be directly to right of the plate; next to that will be spoon.
- What about the dessert spoon? 
- That comes above the plate.The glass should be positioned directly above the knife. Put the bread plate above the fork.The table is set. It looks very good.Let's bring the food now.
- We have chicken soup, mashed potatoes, meatballs, pickles( 泡菜, 咸菜 ), salad and cherry cake.


# 5. Table Manners

- Sit down, everybody, dinner's ready. The first thing that we need to do is put our napkin on our lap. First let's eat the soup. You need to wait to start your soup until everybody got served.
- > Lily, we don't pick up the bowl and `slurp(vt. 出声地吃或喝)` the soup like this. You must use your spoon. Hold you soup spoon like you `would( 使用“would”是因为它表达了假设的情况或条件语句，而不是未来的动作。 "Would"通常用于过去时态，以描述现在或未来的假设或不确定情况 )` hold it as a pencil.
- Does the soup have any meat in it, mom?
- > No, Brian, it doesn't. It only has the vegetables and noodles.
- Leticia, pass the meatballs, please.
- > Here u go, dad.
- Brian, Don't put your elbows on the table `when(为啥这里不用while? 使用“when”是因为它指的是进餐时具体的时间或时刻。另一方面，“while”用于描述与另一个动作同时发生的动作，并不一定指特定的时刻。例如，“我开车时听音乐”表示听音乐的动作与开车的动作同时发生。在原始句子的语境中，“when”是更合适的词，因为说话者指的是进食时的具体时刻，而不是描述两个同时发生的动作。)` you are eating and sit straight. That's not really great manners to have your elbows out. 
- > Lily, don't chew with your mouth open.
- Sorry, mom.
- > Leticia, never `reach across( reach across 伸手过去横跨：用手或手臂伸过去，通常是为了拿到或触摸远处的东西。ps: Across"通常作为介词使用，后面接名词或代词，表示在某个物体或空间上从一侧到另一侧移动。例如："He walked across the bridge", 他走过了桥。"Cross"可以作为动词、名词或形容词使用，表示穿过、跨过或交叉。例如："She crossed the street" 她穿过了街道。)` a `dish`(一般指的是一盘菜, dish强调的是一盘食物, 而不是碟子/盘子本身, 当然也可以指碟子/盘子, 特殊用法: 全部餐具`the dishes`) or someone else's `plate`(盘子, 碟子) to `reach(为什么这里又有一个reach? 第一个reach across表示"伸手横跨", 第二个"reach"是作为动词使用的，表示"伸手拿"、"够到"、"抓住"等意思。)`something. Instead, politely ask the person sitting next to you to "Please pass me the salt.".
- Brian , could you hand me the pickles?
- Can I have some more potatoes, mom?
- > Would you like have some more meatballs?
- No, mom. They are delicious but I'm full, and I need to save room for dessert too.
- > Lily, don't get up and leave. It's not polite.Always ask to be `excused(v. 原谅，宽恕；辩解，开脱；准许……离开；同意免除)` when finished.Let's clear the table now.

- me when I lose things.

- I've look everywhere, it's not here.I must have dropped it somewhere, but I can't figure out where.
- > Don't panic, it's `bound`(adj. 必然的，肯定的；受约束的) to be around here somewhere.

- > Oh, chill out, Brian. Let's just try and `work out`( 解决，算出，制定； ) where you left it. Let's see ... Where did you go from the library?
- Well, I `popped into`(`pop`adj. 流行音乐的;大众的 v. 迅速去;砰地爆开, 这里`pop into`表示"迅速走进") a cafe to buy some cookies, then I went directly to the bus station.

- Good news, the bus drivers found your book and will return it to you in the morning.


# 7. How was You Day?

- Hi, I'm home, have u had a good day?
- > No, not really. Actually it's been a bit of nightmare.
- Oh dear, What's happened?
- > Well, first, i waited in all morning for the new TV to be delivered, but they never showed up.
- Oh, I don't believe it! `Hadn't` they promised to be here today?
- > Yeah, I'm not suprised, to be honest, they didn't show up last week either. I was pretty angry, though.

## 5.Table Manners餐桌礼仪

大家请坐，晚饭好了。我们需要做的第一件事就是把餐巾放在膝盖上。首先让我们吃汤。你需要等到每个人都有了才能开始喝汤。

莉莉，我们不能像这样拿碗并咕噜咕噜地喝汤。你必须用汤匙。拿汤匙时，像拿笔一样拿着。

这汤里有肉吗，妈妈？

不，布莱恩，没有。只有蔬菜和面条。

莱蒂西娅，请把肉丸递给我。

好的，爸爸。

布莱恩，在你吃饭时不要把手肘放在桌子上，要坐直。这样把手肘伸出去不太礼貌。

莉莉，不要张开嘴巴嚼东西。

对不起，妈妈。

莱蒂西娅，不要伸手横跨盘子或别人的去够某物。相反，礼貌地向你旁边的人说“请把盐递给我。”。

布莱恩，你能把泡菜递给我吗？

我还能再要点土豆吗，妈妈？

你想再来一些肉丸吗？

不用了，妈妈。它们很好吃，但我饱了，我也需要为甜点留点地方。

莉莉，不要起身离开。这不礼貌。当吃完的时候总要请求准许离开的。现在让我们收拾桌子。


## 6.Lost And Found失物招领

莱蒂西亚，你拿了我的书《史前和古代文明》吗？

没有，我没有拿。我拿这书干嘛? 我甚至都不喜欢历史

我找不到它了，这是我今天从图书馆借的书。我想我把它弄丢了。

也许你把它落在学校了？

不是，不在那儿. 因为我下课后就去了图书馆。噢，当我丢东西的时候真是让我太烦了.

你在你的房间里找过了吗？

我到处都找了，它不在这里。我一定是在某个地方掉了它，但我不知道在哪里。

别慌，肯定在附近某个地方。

不是啊，我觉得它永远都找不到了，这是一本很重要的书！我需要它做我的历史项目。

冷静下来，布莱恩。我们来尝试弄清楚你把它放在哪里了。我们看看……你从图书馆去哪里了？

嗯，我去了一家咖啡馆买了些饼干，然后直接去了汽车站。

你在公交车上从背包里拿出书来了吗？

没错，我浏览了几分钟，然后放回去准备下车。

噢，我记得在下车之前，我绊倒了差点从楼梯摔下来。

但幸运的是，我用脚着陆了。然后我就直接回家了。当我想从背包里拿出来看时，它已经不在那里了，它就这样消失了。

它肯定是在摔倒时把它从背包里掉出去了。也许你忘记了拉上背包的拉链。

我觉得你说得对，这很有道理。

我们告诉妈妈这件事，看看需要采取什么措施。

别担心，我会打电话给公交车站，问一下他们司机是否万一把书遗留在那里了。

好消息，公交车司机找到了你的书，明天早上会把它送回来。


## 7.How was your day?你今天过得怎么样？

嗨，我回来了，你今天过得好吗？

不太好，实际上有点噩梦般的一天。

哦，亲爱的，发生了什么事？

首先，我整个上午都在等新电视的送货，但他们没露面。

哦，我不敢相信！他们不是答应今天来吗？

是的，我不惊讶, 说实话，他们上周也没来。我当时很生气虽然。

我猜你是的。

总之，我给他们打了电话，他们说下周一他们一定会来。

下周一？他们真是不知羞耻。

这是他们能做到的最早的时间，他们说。

我告诉他们，如果他们下次还不来，我就会取消订单。

完全正确。那电视可是花了一大笔钱！

然后我的笔记本电脑在我上网时崩溃了，我不能工作了。我想它中了病毒。

你没有安装那个反病毒软件吗？

我忘了安装。

难怪你中了病毒。如果你愿意，稍后我会看看它。

然后布莱恩的老师打电话给我说他在休息时间打架被抓住了。

打架？这以前从来没有发生过。我想知道什么让他陷入麻烦

他说是另一个男孩先动手的。

别担心，我们会解决的。我一会儿去找他谈谈。有吃的吗？我饿了！

晚饭放在烤箱里了。那你今天过得怎么样？

嗯，实际上我今天过得还不错。至少我们中有一个人今天过得不错。
