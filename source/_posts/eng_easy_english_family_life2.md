# 1. Sharing Chores

- Brian, your dad and I want you to start doing some chores（家务）.

- > But I already tidy up（/ˈtaɪdi ʌp/整理，收拾, tidy 表示 "使...整洁; 整理"） my room. Isn't that enough?

- You also need to do chores around the house.
The whole family must contribute（/kənˈtrɪbjuːt/为 ... 做出贡献） to how the household(n.家庭 adj. 家用的, 一家人的) runs(运行）,
When children help out(帮忙：在某人需要时提供援助或支持), chores get done sooner. 
This frees up(释放; 使某人有空闲时间) time for the family to do fun things together.

- >Okay, so what exactly do I have to do? 

- Let's start with putting dirty clothes in the hamper(带盖子的篮子, 美国特指"脏衣篓"), watering(water可以当动词, 意为"用水来做某事", 比如此处就是用水给植物浇水) the plants（植物） and taking out the trash（垃圾）.

- >okay, what else?

- how about setting and clearing the dining room table?

- >is that all? 

- And loading and unloading the dishwasher(洗碗机, dish: 碗; wash: 洗;). 

- >But I don't know how to do that. 

- I will teach you. It's really easy. 

- >Do I have to do all of these things every day? 

- No, I want you to share these chores with Leticia. 
you can both decide which ones you want to do. 

- >that's not fair（公平的）.

- why isn't this fair? 

- >She's going to pick the easiest（容易的，轻松的） ones for herself and give me the harder chores to do. 

- No, she won't. I'll take care of that. 

- >you don't know Leticia.
If I have to share chores with my sister, I am going to be doing most of the work.

- I'll keep an eye on her（盯着她） and make sure she won't cheat（欺骗; 逃避）, I promise. 


# 2.Giving Instructions

- Okay, so let me show（通过示范 教） you how to load（装载） the dishwasher.
 On the top rack（架子，支架） we must put the bowls（碗/boʊl/）, cups（cup的复数形式）, mugs（马克杯） and glasses（玻璃杯） facing down（面朝下） so the water will drain out. 
We need to leave space between the glasses and other items, because the water can cause the glasses to bang together and crack（破裂）.
- pretty easy so far（到目前为止） what do we put on the bottom rack? 
- The bottom rack should be used for plates, large bowls, pots and pants.
- what about the forks, spoons and knives? 
- We must put them in the cutlery basket.
- can I put this plate on the top rack? 
There's no room for it on the bottom rack. 
- no, we shouldn't overload the dishwasher.
- why not?
- a dishwasher is less effective if it's crammed full of stuff. 
The dishes will not come out clean.
we can watch the items that are left out by hand.
- The dishwasher is loaded now, what's next? 
- Next, we put the detergent（洗涤剂/dɪˈtɜːrdʒənt/） in the dishwasher. 
We open the detergent drawer（抽屉/drɔːr/）, add the tablet（片剂，丸/ˈtæblət/） with the red ball facing up and closed the drawer. 
Now let's choose the eco program（程序） and press start. 
Once（一旦） the cycle is finished, check that the detergent has done its job, it's fully（充分地，彻底地） rinsed（冲洗） away and that the dishes（餐具，dish的复数形式） are dry（干燥的，干的）.
If they're still don't let them drive for about 30 minutes before putting（put的现在分词形式） them away . 





# 3. Cooking Dinner

- Honey we're out of bread. Could you go to the store and buy two loaves?
- Yeah, sure no problem.
- And we also need some mangos, lemons and some avocados(/ ˌævəˈkɑːdəʊz /鳄梨) and two rolls of paper towels( towel巾, paper towel纸巾 ).
- Do you need any help with dinner mom?
- Yes, could you please make the mashed( 捣碎 ) potatoes?
- Ok, where are the potatoes?
- The patotoes are in the cellar(/ ˈselər /地窖,  cellular/ ˈseljələr /蜂窝式的). There are right in the middle under the cheese and between the pumpkin(南瓜) and the flour(/ ˈflaʊər /面粉) sacks(sack袋 ).
- And how many should I peel( 剥皮 )?
- About twenty will do.
- Where's the peeler?
- The peeler is in the second drawer to the right of the oven(/ ˈʌv(ə)n /烤箱 ).
- and really, you can use any of the pods.
- Is this one ok?
- It's perfect.
- Cover the potatoes with water and add a generous pinch(大捏：一种用于烹饪的量词，表示需要加入较多的调味料，但不是精确的量。pinch: 捏，掐，拧；一撮；偷窃；) of salt.
- Bring them to the boil and cook them for 30 minutes.
- What're you making there?
- Turkey meatballs.
- Wow, I love them! Please show me how to cook them!
- In a large bowl, combine ground(切碎的) turkey, bread crumbs(面包屑), 1 onion, parsley(芹菜), 2 eggs, garlic, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Then mix well.
- Add oil to the pan and wait a few seconds for it to heat up. Shape(使成型) the mixture in balls and carefully place them in the hot pan. Fry the meatballs until browned on all sides.
- That's it? It's not hard at all.
- That's right.
- The potatoes are really soft now.
- We must drain them and use the potatoes masher to mash the potatoes. Pour over some warm milk, then add a little butter and sour(/ ˈsaʊər /酸的) cream.


# 4. Setting The Table

- Dinner is almost ready.Let's set the table, Brian!
- Ok, dad.
- Let's put the plates and bowls on the table.
- Perfect. Now let's put a napkin(餐巾) on the table by each person's plate on the left side.
- Next, let's bring the spoons and forks.
- We're going to place the fork to the left of the plate.
- It's ok if I put it on top of the napkin?
- Better put it next to it. The knife will be directly to right of the plate; next to that will be spoon.
- What about the dessert spoon? 
- That comes above the plate.The glass should be positioned directly above the knife. Put the bread plate above the fork.The table is set. It looks very good.Let's bring the food now.
- We have chicken soup, mashed potatoes, meatballs, pickles( 泡菜, 咸菜 ), salad and cherry cake.


# 5. Table Manners

- Sit down everybody, dinner's ready. The first thing that we need to do is put our napkin on our lap. First, let's eat the soup. You need to wait to start your soup until everybody get served.
- Lily, we don't pick up the bowl and slurp(  ) soup like this. You must use your spoon. Hold you soup spoon like you would(  ) hold it as a pencil.
- Does the soup have any meat in it, mom?
- No, Brian. It only has the vegetables and noodles.
- Leticia, pass the meatballs, please.
- Here u go, dad.
- Brian, Don't put your elbows on the table when(为啥这里不用while) you are eating and sit straight. That's not really great manners having your elbows out. 
- Lily, don't chew with your mouth open.
- Sorry, mom.
- Leticia, never reach cross a dish or someone else's plate to reach(为什么这里又有一个reach?  )something.Instead, politely ask the person next to you to "Please pass me the salt.".
- Brian , could you hand me the pickles?
- Would you like to have some meatballs?
- Thank you. They are delicious, but I'm full, and I need to save room for the dessert too.
- Lily, don't get up and leave. It's not polite.Always ask to be excused when finished.Let's clear the table now.


# 6. Lost and Found

- Have you taken my book, Prehistoric and Ancient Civilizations, Leticia?
- No, I haven't, What should I do with such a book, I don't even like history.
- I can't find it anywhere, It's a book that I borrowed from the library today.I think I've lost it.
- Maybe you left it in school.
- No, it's not there, because I went to the library after classes. Oh, it really bugs(  ) me when I lose things.
- Have you looked into your room?
- I've look everywhere, it's not here.I must have dropped it somewhere, but I can't figure out where.
- Don't panic, it bound to be around here somewhere.
- It's not, I think it's lost for good(  ) and it's such an important book! I need it for my history project.
- Oh, chill out, Brian. Let's just try and work out(  ) where you left it. Let's see ... Where did you go from the library?
- Well, I popped into cafe and buy some cookies, then I went directly to the bus station.
- Did you take you book out of your backpack on the bus?
- Yes, I did. I browsed it from a few minutes, then I put it back and prepared to(这是个短语?  ) get off the bus. 
- Oh, I remember that right before getting off I stumbled(  ) almost fell down the stairs. But luckily, I landed on my feet. And then I came staight home. And When I wanted to take it out of my backpack and read it, it wasn't there any longer(  ), it just disappeared.
- That must have fallen out of your backpack when you stumbled in the bus.Maybe you forgot to zip up(  ) your backpack.
- I think you are right. It makes sense.
- Let's tell mom about it and see what needs to be done in this case.
- Well, Don't worry. I'm going to call the bus depot(  ) and ask if the bus driver left the book there by any chance.
- Good news, the bus drivers found your book and will return it to you in the morning.
