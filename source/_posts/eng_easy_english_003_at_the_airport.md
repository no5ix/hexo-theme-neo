# CHECK-IN

- Hello, may I see your passport, please? 
- > Here you go 
- thank you. And where are you flying with us today? 
- > I am going to London, i'll be studying there for a year. 
- How fun! that sounds like a great trip. I see your information right here. Are you `checking any bags`(put the bags on the airplane inside the `cargo`货物 `compartment`隔层) today? 
- > Yes, just one. 
- Perfect if you could place it on the `scale`(the equipment that tells you the weight ofyour luggage) for me, that would be great. 
- > Here you go, 
- thank you. Hmm, it appears your bag is just a bit too heavy. It's over our weight requirement. Perhaps you could take something out of your bag and put it in your `carry-on bag`(the small bag you take with you on the airplane)?
- > Yes, i'll take this big book out of the bag, no problem. 
- Great, now your bag is ready to be checked and I see you've chosen a window seat. Is that still OK for you? 
- > I think so. I've never flown before so I thought it would be nice to look out at the clouds. Do you think it will be a good seat for me? 
- This is your first flight? well, that's fantastic! you're going to love it. And yes, I think the window seat is an excellent choice for you then. Let me print your boarding pass and you'll be ready to go.
- > okay.
- Here it is, you're all set.
- > thanks.
- you're going to depart from terminal C Gate 54. (`terminal`: a building within an airport where passengers go to depart on a flight)
- > When do I need to be there? 
- You should get to your gate about one hour before `departure`(the time planes leave the airport). 
- And how do I get to the gate? 
- > You will turn left at the coffee shop. Security will be directly in front of you. Once you're finished `clearing security`(move through security successfully), follow the signs to Gate 54. It will be on your right. 
- Thank you so much for your help. 
- > You're very welcome, enjoy your flight !

- > What's wrong?
- please `step to the side`(step to a place that is on one side: away from other people).
- > Stretch out your arms, I'm going to scan your body.
- are you wearing any jewelry ? 
- > Oh yeah, I think my necklace triggered the alarm. Sorry about that.
- Allright. `U r all clear`(everything is okay).
