## An old woman in a red dress

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,319
Speaker 1: All right, let me start with  a warning. If you do not want to see the  

2
00:00:03,319 --> 00:00:07,000
worst of the United States of America, if you  don't want to hear from the people who endanger  

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:17,520
the very continuation of American democracy,  then you should turn to something else right  

4
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:22,599
now. Our correspondent Luke Beasley, who,  by the way, is getting really good at this,  

5
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:28,399
went to the Donald Trump rally in Conway, South  Carolina, over the weekend. This may be some of  

6
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:35,719
Luke's best stuff. It gets dangerous during these  interviews. He spoke to Trump supporters. We are  

7
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:43,039
going to go through these one by one. There's just  a handful of clips. Really prepare yourself to be  

8
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:52,279
terrified about what may be in America's future.  Here's the first interviewee, Luke, speaking to,  

9
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:59,079
a woman at the Trump rally in South Carolina. Speaker 4: Would you rather four years of dictator  

10
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:04,463
Trump or four years of democratically  elected Joe Biden dictator Trump? 

11
00:01:04,465 --> 00:01:12,959
Speaker 1: And there it is. Dictator Trump.  These people are dangerous. These people are  

12
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:17,919
dangerous. They need to be treated as such. Speaker 2: And again, that's a that's a lie.  

13
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,439
You're a liar. It's the first day he  said I'll be a dictator for one day to  

14
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,868
put in the border. And, one other thing. Speaker 4: You're a drill, baby. Drill. 

15
00:01:27,868 --> 00:01:34,747
Speaker 2: You're part, you're part of you're  part of the media, a baby media turkey. 

16
00:01:34,748 --> 00:01:38,587
Speaker 1: He's a baby media Turk, you. Speaker 2: Are right there. 

17
00:01:38,588 --> 00:01:42,479
Speaker 4: Wow, that was explosive. Speaker 2: In training and training.  

18
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:52,360
Good job. Apply to CNN. MSNBC here. Great. Speaker 1: There was a time where we would  

19
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:57,799
have gone to such a rally and found policy  disagreements, but we wouldn't have found  

20
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:04,438
people who would say, I'd rather a dictator  over a Democrat. There was a time where that  

21
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:10,639
was not the nature of the disagreement. The  woman then takes Luke's microphone and I  

22
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:15,919
guess interviews him about it. Speaker 4: Oh, yes. Something  

23
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:19,467
fun. All right, I'm ready. Speaker 2: Hi, there. Hello. Hey. 

24
00:02:19,468 --> 00:02:23,359
Speaker 4: What a bad thing about my wife to read. Speaker 1: Martin, you know, the question is,  

25
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,549
what's a bad thing about Biden?  Now we're going to get into policy. 

26
00:02:26,549 --> 00:02:30,999
Speaker 2: The inflation. He's a crook. He is. Speaker 4: He's like the guy who's been  

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,679
indicted four times. Speaker 2: Come on, come  

28
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:40,120
on. Not convicted. Okay. He's a crook. He stole  money from country. He stole this left and right  

29
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,999
and made business deals to get. Okay, he said. Speaker 1: Understand that this is mush mouth  

30
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,400
nonsense. These are all confused words.  Salads of stuff you hear on Fox News. 

31
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,880
Speaker 4: Received millions  from foreign governments while  

32
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:59,758
he was president. He doesn't trust. Speaker 2: Businesses. He doesn't take  

33
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:09,438
those out is not true. He said, lgtbq you LGBTQ?  Hey, I know you people do belong. Do believe in  

34
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:15,958
the transgender library story hours for children. Speaker 4: I think they're called drag queen story  

35
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:20,908
hours, right. Which is different than transgender. Speaker 2: And they dress up demonically. 

36
00:03:20,908 --> 00:03:25,348
Speaker 4: So would you say you're  you're motivated, to protect the kids? 

37
00:03:25,348 --> 00:03:26,519
Speaker 2: Absolutely. Speaker 4: And so,  

38
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,319
are you concerned with the leading cause  of death for children being firearms? And  

39
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:31,999
Trump doesn't do anything about that. Speaker 2: You're leading cause of,  

40
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:37,879
death for children is abortion. Do your homework. Speaker 4: If we if we only talk about people who  

41
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:43,159
have been born leading cause of death for  children is firearms. And this guy just  

42
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:49,078
spoke yesterday at the NRA convention, we could do  commonsense gun reforms that could protect lives,  

43
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,719
save those beautiful children you're talking  about. But instead, we're all focused on being  

44
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:59,358
distracted by drag queen story. Our really. 


## A man who insisted Trump never post a social truth.

Speaker 1: We need to do away with the false  

45
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,879
notion that if we just sit these folks down,  we can talk them out of their delusions. Some  

46
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,319
of them we can, but at scale. That's not  how we're going to win. We need to win  

47
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:14,439
by going around these people and making them  politically irrelevant might not be nice. Oh,  

48
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:18,079
but they deserve they. They get to vote. I'm not  saying you don't let them vote. I'm saying we  

49
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:24,039
make their vote irrelevant by turning out in  such large numbers. Here's another guy that,  

50
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:31,160
Luke interviewed shows him Trump's post The Truth  Social about suspending the Constitution. The guy  

51
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:36,999
insists that it's fake. Someone is making it  look like that's Trump posting it, but Trump  

52
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,599
would never post that. Luke shows it to him. This  is again evidence that you show him the proof.  

53
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:49,600
They just don't accept that. They say it's fake. Speaker 4: And would you support somebody if they  

54
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,119
called for the termination of the Constitution?  No. Can I show you something? Because I'm shocked  

55
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,439
that so many people don't know about this.  On Truth Social, this is from Trump's true  

56
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:01,358
social. Because of his belief that the election  was stolen. He said a massive fraud of this  

57
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,509
magnitude allows for the termination of all rules,  regulations and articles. You don't believe. 

58
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:09,520
Speaker 3: That? I don't believe that. Speaker 4: Even though he sent it out  

59
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:12,748
on true social. That's not true.  That's still up on his account. 

60
00:05:12,749 --> 00:05:16,028
Speaker 3: No, that's not true. That  somebody made a fake thing, okay? 

61
00:05:16,028 --> 00:05:19,919
Speaker 1: Somebody made a fake thing.  That's Trump's truth. Social accounts. 

62
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,199
Speaker 5: Essential. Speaker 1: It's not  

63
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:27,878
even disputed. It's been defended by some MAGA  people. Some people see that and they go, well,  

64
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:34,638
listen, when the left goes so crazy, you've got to  potentially suspend the Constitution. But then you  

65
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:40,398
have people like that guy who got it's not really  Trump. The evidence doesn't sway them that that  

66
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:46,759
is the proof of what we've been saying. They are  impervious to evidence.


## A man who said it's not a insurrection

Here's another guy Luke,  

67
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:59,438
interviews in some sort of, biker group, vest with  the Trump hat. Well. It's. It's depressing. Guys. 

68
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:02,838
Speaker 3: Was not an insurrection. Speaker 4: What was it? 

69
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:08,239
Speaker 3: It was the overthrow of the government. Speaker 1: It wasn't an insurrection. It was an  

70
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:15,720
overthrow of the government. Now, I dare you. To  try to parse the syntax in the next 45 seconds  

71
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:21,519
of video. I dare you to figure out what this guy  is saying. I know English is my second language,  

72
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:27,062
so maybe that's why I can't do it. But maybe  you can help me. What is this guy talking about? 

73
00:06:27,062 --> 00:06:29,438
Speaker 3: Yeah, in my opinion. Speaker 4: By Trump supporters. 

74
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:31,919
Speaker 3: Absolutely not. Speaker 4: Who is  

75
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,1000
overthrowing the government? Speaker 3: Well, they were in  

76
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:41,719
there trying to, make a, a fake. I don't know.  I'm trying to think of the word the election  

77
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:46,468
was was they were trying to make it. Speaker 4: Certifying it. Yes. Okay. 

78
00:06:46,468 --> 00:06:51,359
Speaker 3: And he didn't win. They were trying  to falsify. Get it all through before anybody  

79
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,1000
did anything. My opinion. Speaker 4: So then who? Who  

80
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,919
stormed the Capitol? The storming the Capitol. Speaker 3: Never happened. Well, there were some  

81
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:04,280
CIA agents in there, from what I understand. Speaker 4: So then the CIA agents were  

82
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:08,267
storming the Capitol to stop the  certification of Biden's election. 

83
00:07:08,269 --> 00:07:17,349
Speaker 3: No. To make it look like Biden's people  did it. I mean, Trump's people did it. Yeah. 

84
00:07:17,348 --> 00:07:23,038
Speaker 1: That is quite a yarn that that  guy is spinning. He doesn't even understand  

85
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:28,599
the conspiracy theories. When I appeared on the  Jessy Lee Peterson show a few years ago. It was  

86
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:33,080
evident that Jesse didn't understand his own  conspiracy theories. This is another example  

87
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:40,119
of that. 


## A man who talked about if Trump was a civilly liable rapist

Here's another interview. And each  one scarier and more dangerous than the last.  

88
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,879
And by the way, really great job by Luke here. Speaker 5: Everything that the media has said  

89
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:49,438
over the years has been proven wrong. Every time  somebody starts a legal case against Donald Trump,  

90
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:54,498
eventually they lose Donald Trump. Speaker 4: Oh, yes, sir. 

91
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:58,519
Speaker 5: Sir, you tell me something. Speaker 4: That $83.3 million is going  

92
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:03,839
to have to pay to Eugene Carroll. Also,  no, you wait a minute. Listen. Why why  

93
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:08,999
are you supporting a civilly liable rapist? Speaker 1: By the way, congratulations to Luke  

94
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,719
for adopting civilly liable rapist. I don't  claim to have come up with it, and I'm not  

95
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:19,388
saying he got it from me, but I love that he  is now using that term with Trump supporters. 

96
00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:22,200
Speaker 5: Because you're a moron  for even saying that you truly are. 

97
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:27,267
Speaker 4: That's quite literally the facts. Speaker 5: Are you that a judge said. 

98
00:08:27,269 --> 00:08:29,240
Speaker 4: A jury found him  liable for sexual abuse? 

99
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:35,480
Speaker 5: A judge said he is guilty and we're  going to go ahead and move to the ice. It's going  

100
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:40,840
to be overturned, sir. Trust me. Save this.  When it's overturned, you all look back and  

101
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:45,399
go. I should have been more aware. I shouldn't  have believed the bullshit. All right. Have  

102
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:49,828
a good one. You know, all the pedophiles  up at DC, they all need to go to get Mo. 

103
00:08:49,828 --> 00:08:52,639
Speaker 1: The guys back, by the way. Speaker 4: Does Trump's close  

104
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:56,038
relationship with Epstein bother you at all? Speaker 5: Trump and have said, here's the  

105
00:08:56,039 --> 00:09:00,918
deal. Trump has had his picture taken  with everybody. The only relationship  

106
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:05,319
they had was Trump had his picture taken  with Epstein. Trump has been photobomb. 

107
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:09,480
Speaker 4: He said, oh, I've seen like some young. Speaker 5: Well yeah, that's you know,  

108
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,720
the whole thing. Speaker 4: That's a  

109
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,159
great friend of mine. Like. Speaker 5: No he's not. No.  

110
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:17,958
The whole Covid thing was a scam. Speaker 1: It's funny when they  

111
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:22,960
say it's a scam. Like who's scammed who? And  Luke does a good job of getting this guy on  

112
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,846
the record on this, and it goes nowhere. Speaker 5: Ivermectin most, by the way. 

113
00:09:26,846 --> 00:09:28,640
Speaker 1: Ivermectin. Speaker 5: I started taking  

114
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:31,667
ivermectin immediately. Speaker 4: I hope not. 

115
00:09:31,668 --> 00:09:33,279
Speaker 5: Yeah, absolutely. Speaker 4: It was proven to  

116
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,319
be not effective for Covid. Speaker 5: It's the dumbest  

117
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,959
thing that I ever heard. Speaker 4: I learned a. 

118
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,040
Speaker 5: Lot. Best thing I ever heard. Speaker 4: Well, we got to focusing on  

119
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:44,228
this then. This is the dumbest.  So what was Covid then? It was. 

120
00:09:44,229 --> 00:09:46,999
Speaker 5: Fake. Covid was  a bioweapon. They actually  

121
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,879
used HIV and they stitched it into a corona. Speaker 1: Stitched it like cross stitching. 

122
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:55,879
Speaker 4: Like, what's the goal they're. Speaker 5: Using for the HIV? Well, the whole  

123
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:59,079
thing was to lock down the country. Speaker 4: To. 

124
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,588
Speaker 5: For the left tards  to try to take over the country. 

125
00:10:02,589 --> 00:10:05,069
Speaker 4: Left heart? Speaker 5: Yes, the left heart. 

126
00:10:05,068 --> 00:10:14,519
Speaker 1: So why can't you guys just accept that  Covid was fake? But a real bioweapon stitched from  

127
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:23,079
HIV. At crocheted even you could say in order  for the left guards to take over the country  

128
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:28,759
to do what we don't know. It, I don't know.  I don't know why they would. And in order to  

129
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:33,719
achieve what? All right. 


## The last interview

Here's the last one.  And, it's so depressing that we're going to  

130
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,200
have to move on from this because. Speaker 3: We need to save this  

131
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,559
country that's getting thrown away. Speaker 4: What is making it thrown  

132
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:45,679
away? Democrats doing what? Everything  they're doing the Inflation Reduction Act,  

133
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:50,719
lowering prescription drug costs. Take care. Speaker 1: Oh, na. Take care. The guy just  

134
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,800
bailing out when it realized he wasn't  going to steamroll Luke. So simultaneously,  

135
00:10:55,799 --> 00:11:02,959
a fantastic job by Luke Beasley. And you can find  his channel at David pakman.com/luke. And the  

136
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:08,679
worst of the worst of the worst of America. And I  want to be super tactical with this stuff. When I  

137
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:15,039
see this I say to myself, how do we win elections  despite these people? And the way is not to spend  

138
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:20,399
hours trying to convince them. Many of these  folks are delusional in the clinical sense.  

139
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,639
The way to do it is maybe by showing this stuff  to people who say, I might stay home. You say,  

140
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:32,238
really? If you stay home, this guy, right,  the pick, whichever one of those people you  

141
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:38,240
like this guy's vote. He now has more of an  influence over how the country is run than  

142
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,039
you do. You feel good about that? I certainly  would not. And so when I see these videos,  

143
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:50,718
I get extremely motivated to vote. Scary stuff.  These people are dangerous. Very nice job by Luke.

1
00:00:00,000 –> 00:00:03,319
演讲者1：好的，我先给出一个警告。如果你不想看到美国的最糟一面，不想听到那些威胁到美国民主存续的人发言，

2
00:00:03,319 –> 00:00:07,000
那你现在应该去看别的东西。

3
00:00:10,320 –> 00:00:17,520
我们的记者卢克·比斯利最近在这方面越来越得心应手了。

4
00:00:17,519 –> 00:00:22,599
他周末去了南卡罗来纳州康威市的特朗普集会。这可能是卢克最出色的报道之一。

5
00:00:22,600 –> 00:00:28,399
在这些采访中情况变得危险。他采访了特朗普的支持者。我们会逐一放出这些采访片段。

6
00:00:28,399 –> 00:00:35,719
一共只有几个片段。请做好心理准备，看看美国的未来可能会是什么样子。

7
00:00:35,719 –> 00:00:43,039
这是第一个受访者，卢克在南卡罗来纳州的特朗普集会上采访了一位女士。

8
00:00:52,280 –> 00:00:59,079
演讲者4：你是想要四年独裁的特朗普，还是四年民主选举的乔·拜登？

9
00:01:04,465 –> 00:01:12,959
演讲者1：就这样，独裁者特朗普。这些人很危险，必须如此对待他们。

10
00:01:17,919 –> 00:01:23,439
演讲者2：再说一次，这是一派胡言。他说过他会在一天内成为独裁者，只为了修建边境墙。

11
00:01:27,868 –> 00:01:34,747
演讲者4：你们是钻井派，对吧？

12
00:01:34,748 –> 00:01:38,587
演讲者1：对啊。

13
00:01:42,480 –> 00:01:52,360
演讲者2：申请加入CNN或MSNBC吧。

14
00:01:52,359 –> 00:01:57,799
演讲者1：过去我们去这样的集会时，会发现政策上的分歧，但不会听到有人说“我宁愿要独裁者而不是民主党人”。

15
00:01:57,799 –> 00:02:04,438
那时候的分歧不是这个性质。那位女士接过卢克的麦克风，似乎反向采访他了。

16
00:02:10,639 –> 00:02:15,919
演讲者4：哦，是啊，准备好了吗？

17
00:02:19,468 –> 00:02:23,359
演讲者4：有什么关于我妻子的坏话吗？

18
00:02:23,360 –> 00:02:26,549
演讲者1：问题是，有什么关于拜登的坏话吗？

19
00:02:31,000 –> 00:02:32,679
演讲者4：拜登好像被起诉四次了。

20
00:02:45,000 –> 00:02:52,400
演讲者1：请理解，这是一堆胡言乱语。这些话语杂乱无章，全是从福克斯新闻听来的。

21
00:02:55,880 –> 00:02:59,758
演讲者4：特朗普当总统期间从外国政府那里获得了数百万美元。

22
00:02:59,759 –> 00:03:09,438
演讲者2：这不是真的，他说了LGBTQ？

23
00:03:09,439 –> 00:03:15,958
演讲者4：我认为他们称之为“变装皇后故事会”吧，这和变性人不同。

24
00:03:20,908 –> 00:03:25,348
演讲者4：那么，你是为了保护孩子而动员的吗？

25
00:03:26,520 –> 00:03:29,319
演讲者4：你关心的是枪支对儿童造成的威胁吗？

26
00:03:43,159 –> 00:03:49,078
我们可以进行一些常识性的枪支改革，保护你们谈论的那些美丽孩子的生命，但结果我们都被变装故事会分散了注意力。

Speaker 1: 我们需要摒弃那种错误的观念，即如果我们只把这些人找来，我们就能说服他们放弃他们的错觉。有些人我们可以，但在大规模的情况下，这不是我们获胜的方式。我们需要通过绕过这些人，让他们在政治上变得无关紧要，这可能不太友好，哦，但他们是有选举权的。我并不是说不让他们投票，我是说我们通过动员大量选民，使他们的选票变得无关紧要。
这是另一位卢克采访的对象，他展示了特朗普在“真相社交”上关于暂停宪法的帖子。那个人坚称那是假的，认为有人让它看起来像是特朗普发布的，但特朗普绝对不会发这种帖子。卢克给他看了，这再次证明了你给他们看了证据，他们就是不接受。他们说那是假的。

Speaker 4: 如果有人呼吁终止宪法，你会支持吗？
Speaker 3: 不会。能给我看一下吗？我很震惊这么多人不知道这件事。在“真相社交”上，这条内容来自特朗普的“真相社交”账号。因为他相信选举被偷走了，他说这种规模的欺诈行为可以允许终止所有的规则、法规和条款。你不信吗？
Speaker 3: 我不信。
Speaker 4: 即使他发布了这条内容，它仍然保存在他的账户上。
Speaker 3: 不，那不是真的。是有人做了假消息，好的？
Speaker 1: 是的，有人做了假消息。这是特朗普的“真相社交”账户。
Speaker 5: 本质上。
Speaker 1: 这甚至没有争议，一些特朗普的支持者为此辩护。有人看到这个，就说，好吧，当左派变得如此疯狂时，你必须考虑暂停宪法。但随后又有像那个男人一样的人，认为这根本不是特朗普发布的。证据并没有让他们改变看法，这就是我们一直在说的。他们对证据视而不见。

这是另一位卢克采访的人，他穿着某种摩托车俱乐部的背心，戴着特朗普的帽子。嗯，这让人很沮丧，伙计们。

Speaker 3: 这不是一场叛乱。
Speaker 4: 那是什么？
Speaker 3: 这是推翻政府。
Speaker 1: 这不是叛乱。这是推翻政府。现在，我敢打赌，你要在接下来的45秒视频中试图分析语法。
我敢打赌，你也许能搞明白这个人到底在说什么。我知道英语是我的第二语言，也许这就是我听不懂的原因。但也许你能帮我一下。这个人到底在说什么？

Speaker 3: 是的，这是我的观点。
Speaker 4: 是特朗普的支持者吗？
Speaker 3: 绝对不是。
Speaker 4: 那是谁在推翻政府？
Speaker 3: 好吧，他们在那里试图做一些假的事情。我不知道，我在试着想那个词，选举…他们在试图搞定它。
Speaker 4: 认证它。
Speaker 3: 对。没错。
Speaker 4: 那他没有赢。他们试图伪造，让一切在别人做之前就完成。这是我的看法。
Speaker 4: 那么谁冲进了国会大厦呢？
Speaker 3: 根本没发生过。嗯，据我了解，里面有一些CIA特工。
Speaker 4: 所以CIA特工是在冲击国会大厦，阻止认证拜登的选举结果？
Speaker 3: 不。是为了让它看起来是拜登的人做的。我是说，是特朗普的人做的。对。
Speaker 1: 这个家伙编的故事真是太离谱了。他甚至不理解这些阴谋论。几年前我参加杰西·李·彼得森的节目时，很明显杰西也不理解他自己说的阴谋论。这是另一个例子。


## 4

这是另一场采访，每一场都比上一场更可怕、更危险。

顺便说一下，卢克做得非常好。

Speaker 5: 多年来媒体所说的每件事都已被证明是错的。每当有人对特朗普提起法律诉讼，最终他们都会败诉。
Speaker 4: 哦，没错，先生。
Speaker 5: 先生，告诉我一些事情。
Speaker 4: 那8300万美元必须支付给尤金·卡罗尔。另外，等等。听着，为什么你支持一个有民事责任的强奸犯？
Speaker 1: 顺便说一句，祝贺卢克采用了“有民事责任的强奸犯”这个词。我并不声称这是我想出来的，我也不是说他是从我这里学到的，但我喜欢他现在在用这个词形容特朗普的支持者。

Speaker 5: 因为你真的是个傻瓜，居然会说出那种话，你真的是。
Speaker 4: 那就是字面上的事实。
Speaker 5: 你是说法官说他有罪？
Speaker 4: 陪审团判定他对性侵行为负责。
Speaker 5: 法官说他有罪，我们会继续走法律程序。它会被推翻，先生。相信我，保存好这个。当它被推翻的时候，你们都会回头看，觉得“我应该更警觉些，不应该相信那些废话。” 好的，祝你们一切顺利。你知道，华盛顿DC那里的恋童癖都该去死。

Speaker 1: 那个家伙回来了，顺便说一下。
Speaker 4: 特朗普与爱泼斯坦的亲密关系有没有让你感到不安？
Speaker 5: 特朗普和他之间没有什么关系。特朗普和每个人都有合照，他们唯一的关系就是，特朗普和爱泼斯坦有合照。特朗普被拍到了。
Speaker 4: 他还说：“哦，我见过一些年轻人。”
Speaker 5: 好吧，知道了，整个事情就是这样。
Speaker 4: 他说：“他是我很好的朋友。”
Speaker 5: 不，他不是，不是的。
Speaker 5: 整个新冠疫情是个骗局。
Speaker 1: 他们说疫情是骗局时，真有趣。到底是谁被骗了？卢克在这一点上做得很好，他让这个家伙把话说得清清楚楚，但一切都没有结果。

Speaker 5: 顺便说一下，我一开始就服用了伊维菌素。
Speaker 1: 伊维菌素。
Speaker 5: 我立刻开始服用伊维菌素。
Speaker 4: 我希望你没这么做。
Speaker 5: 对，绝对的。
Speaker 4: 它已经被证明对新冠无效了。
Speaker 5: 这是我听过的最傻的事情。
Speaker 4: 我学到了很多。
Speaker 5: 最棒的事情。
Speaker 4: 那么我们就专注于这个吧，这真是最傻的。那么，新冠到底是什么？它是…
Speaker 5: 假的。新冠是生物武器。它实际上是用HIV病毒并将其融入冠状病毒中。
Speaker 1: 是像十字绣一样拼接的吗？
Speaker 4: 嗯，目标是什么呢？
Speaker 5: 目的是封锁国家。
Speaker 4: 是为了…
Speaker 5: 让左翼分子试图接管国家。
Speaker 4: 左翼分子？
Speaker 5: 对，左翼分子。
Speaker 1: 那么你们为什么不能接受新冠是假的，但它却是一个真正的生物武器，是从HIV病毒中拼接出来的？
Speaker 5: 是为了让左翼分子接管国家，做什么我们也不知道。我也不知道他们为什么这么做。为了达成什么目的呢？好的。


## 5

这是最后一段，实在让人沮丧，我们得从这个话题继续前进。

Speaker 3: 我们需要拯救这个正在被抛弃的国家。
Speaker 4: 是什么让它被抛弃了？民主党在做什么？他们在做所有事情，包括《降低通货膨胀法案》，降低处方药费用。
Speaker 1: 哦，不，走吧。这个人刚才意识到他不会碾压卢克，所以就离开了。所以，卢克做得非常好。你可以在 David Pakman 的网站上找到他的频道 / luke。
Speaker 1: 这是美国最糟糕的一群人。我想要用一些非常战术性的思维来处理这些事情。当我看到这些时，我对自己说：我们如何在这些人面前赢得选举？答案不是花费时间去说服他们。许多人在临床意义上是妄想的。
Speaker 1: 做到这一点的方法，可能是把这些视频展示给那些说自己可能会待在家里的人。你说：“真的吗？如果你待在家里，那这个家伙，对吧？无论你选哪个人，他的票现在对国家的运行有更大的影响力。”
Speaker 1: 你觉得这好受吗？我当然不觉得。于是当我看到这些视频时，我变得非常有动力去投票。真是吓人的事情。这些人非常危险。卢克做得非常好。
