# Phrases


## 表示时间点的介词用法

- On：用于表示特定的某一天或日期，如：on Monday, on July 4th。
- At：用于表示具体的某一时刻或时间，如：at 3 o'clock, at noon(因为 noon 在英语中专门指代 12点)。
- In：用于表示一段时间内，如：in the morning, in May, in 2022。
- By：用于表示在某个时间之前完成某事，如：finish the task by 5 p.m.。
- From…to：用于表示从某一时间开始到另一时间结束，如：from Monday to Friday。
- Between…and：用于表示两个时间点之间的时间，如：between 4 and 6 p.m.。

需要注意的是，有些时间点介词的使用是固定的，但有些情况下也需要根据具体语境进行判断。


## a few和a bit的区别

"a few" 和 "a bit" 都是用来表示数量的词组，但在使用上有一些区别。

1. "A few" 表示一个较小的数量，通常是指两个或更多个，但不多于五个。它强调数量的限制和有限性。例如：
   - "I have a few books on the shelf."（我书架上有几本书。）
   - "He has a few friends coming over for dinner."（他有几个朋友要来吃饭。）

2. "A bit" 表示，通常是指不多、不大的程度。它可以用来表示时间、空间、程度的少量。例如：
   - "I need to rest for a bit."（我需要休息一会儿。）
   - "She speaks French a bit."（她会一点点法语。）
   - "The coffee is a bit too hot."（咖啡有点太烫了。）

总的来说，"a few" 表示数量有限但不多，而 "a bit" 主要用来表示程度轻微或程度不高。
