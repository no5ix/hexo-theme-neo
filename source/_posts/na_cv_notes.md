SUMMARY

With over eight years of experience in developing and maintaining robust backend systems using Java and Spring Boot, I specialize in building scalable, high-performance applications that meet complex business requirements and handle millions of transactions daily.
Proficient in designing and implementing RESTful APIs with Spring Boot to enable efficient communication between distributed systems, ensuring APIs are well-documented, secure, and optimized for performance.
Skilled in managing data persistence with Hibernate and JPA, designing complex database schemas, optimizing queries, and ensuring data integrity across large-scale, transactional systems using MongoDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL databases.
Experienced in using Apache Kafka for real-time data processing and event-driven architectures, enabling high-throughput data streams and scalable messaging systems for business processes.
Knowledgeable in implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms using Spring Security and OAuth2, ensuring backend services are secure, comply with industry standards, and protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
Skilled in integrating third-party services and external APIs, including AWS services (such as S3 and RDS), into Java applications, enhancing functionality and extending system capabilities while ensuring secure, reliable data exchange.
Adept at optimizing backend performance through caching with Redis, query optimization, and asynchronous processing techniques, which significantly reduce response times and enhance the scalability and efficiency of applications.
Proficient in using Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration, allowing the deployment of scalable, resilient backend services across various environments with high availability and fault tolerance.
Experienced in implementing complex business logic in Java, designing multi-threaded applications to manage concurrent tasks efficiently, ensuring backend services perform optimally and handle high transaction volumes.
Proficient in using Maven and Gradle for build automation, dependency management, and continuous integration, streamlining development and ensuring high-quality builds and deployments.
Skilled in designing and managing microservices architectures with Spring Boot, enabling modular, scalable applications that support independent deployment, maintenance, and rapid iteration.
Experienced in conducting comprehensive testing with JUnit and Mockito, writing unit and integration tests to ensure backend service reliability, stability, and high code coverage to detect issues early in development.
Adept at managing and optimizing large-scale RDBMS and NoSQL databases like MySQL, Redis, and Cassandra, ensuring high availability, fault tolerance, and efficient data retrieval in high-load environments.
Proficient in implementing GraphQL APIs, optimizing data fetching to reduce network data transfer, which enhances the performance and efficiency of client-server communication.
Skilled in using Jenkins for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, automating the build, test, and deployment processes to ensure reliable and consistent code delivery to production environments.
Knowledgeable in implementing advanced logging and monitoring solutions with tools like Splunk and ELK Stack, enabling real-time tracking of backend performance, error detection, and proactive issue resolution for system reliability and uptime.
Adept at collaborating with cross-functional teams, including frontend developers, DevOps engineers, and data scientists, using Jira and Slack to deliver cohesive, end-to-end solutions that integrate seamlessly across the tech stack, ensuring backend services meet the needs of the entire system architecture.
